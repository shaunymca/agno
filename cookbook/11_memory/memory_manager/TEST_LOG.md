## Runtime Results

### 01_standalone_memory.py

**Status:** PASS
**Time:** ~3s
**Description:** Standalone MemoryManager CRUD: add, get, delete, replace user memories via PostgresDb.

### 03_custom_memory_instructions.py

**Status:** PASS (after fix)
**Time:** ~35s
**Description:** Custom memory capture instructions with two different models. First manager uses OpenAI with academic-only instructions, second uses Claude for default capture.

**Triage:** regression (fixed)
**Fix:** Changed `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest` to `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` -- the older model does not support structured outputs required by MemoryManager.
